The Body Mass Index (BMI) or Quetelet index is a value derived from the mass weight and height of an individual. 
The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is universally expressed in units of kg/mÂ². By analyzing the BMI value, we can determine a diagnostic.
